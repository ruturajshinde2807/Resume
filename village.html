         Karad is a city in Satara district of Indian state of Maharashtra and it is 320 km (180.19 miles) from Mumbai and 159 km from Pune. It lies at the confluence of Koyna River and the Krishna River known as the "Priti sangam". The two rivers originate at Mahabaleshwar (famous hill station in Satara- Maharashtra), which is around 100 km from Karad. They diverge at their origin, and travel for about the same distance to meet again in Karad. The rivers meet exactly head on, thus forming letter "T" which is the only head on confluence in the world. Hence Krishna and Koyna river's confluence is called Preeti Sangam, meaning Confluence of Love. Karad is well known for sugar production and is known as the sugar bowl of Maharashtra owing to the presence of many sugar factories in and around Karad. It is considered as an important educational hub in Western Maharashtra due to the presence of many prestigious educational institutes. This place is also known for resting place or (Samadhi) of the first chief minister of Maharashtra Shri. Yashwantrao Chavan situated at the confluence of Krishna and Koyana river.</p>
